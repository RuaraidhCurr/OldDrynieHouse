# OldDrynieHouse

The aim of this project is to create a website for Alasdair Mckenzie to promote his B&B situated just outside inverness in Kilmuir resting on the banks of Moray Firth. This website is to be aimed towards golfers from amsterdam as the airport close by in inverness has flights in and out to amsterdam each day. They aim for this website to get Alasdair and his B&B them more customers over the golfing season.

## Description given of Rooms
The Secret Garden Family Suite is located beside the main house with beautiful views across the Secret Garden to our lawns and the sea beyond. You can sit in peace in the lovely lounge next door to your bedrooms, or outside in the Secret Garden itself. Breakfast is served in the main house. The Family Suite comprises two large bedrooms with their own TV, Wi-Fi, fridge, tea and coffee making facilities and a large shower-room shared by the four of you. The Master bedroom benefits from two double glazed French Doors each leading to a patio.

Room comparison: Please note that if you want to stay in the Secret Garden rooms as a couple, you would be better booking the Secret Garden Double Room (with its spa bath and shower, and at a slightly lower cost) than the Secret Garden Family Suite. If you book the Family Suite for two, the Twin room is blocked off, meaning you get the same size of room as our Secret Garden Double Room but without the spa bath.

## Golf Information
If you are a keen golfer then this is a superb base from which to explore some of the famous North of Scotland courses, Royal Dornoch, Nairn West and the new “super-courses” at Spey Valley and Castle Stuart. We are less than 30mins from most of these, Dornoch being the furthest away at 45 minutes. As well, we are close to a range of other excellent courses.

Exclusive means, we only worry about you. Your party of three or four golfers, (and partners if you wish), will have all this to themselves.

4 large luxurious bedrooms, each with either a private bathroom or a private shower-room
Private lounge with books, magazines and DVDs
20 acres of beautiful parkland and paddocks with its itinerant wildlife
Short iron practice range
Full sized billiards/snooker table
Other sports/leisure equipment in our Games Room
We will collect you from Inverness Airport, and deliver you back there at the end of your trip.

Your party can stay as long as you like and play as many of our great golf courses as you’d like to play. We will give you a full breakfast in the morning, take you to the Golf Course, organise caddies and lunch, collect you and then take you sight-seeing or shopping.

At night we’ll deliver you to the restaraunt of your choice, collect you after your meal and take you back to Drynie. In short, you’ll be pampered and completely spoilt.

We offer you and your golfing buddies a golf holiday you’ll probably remember for ever. The North of Scotland offers an outstanding destination for golfers worldwide. Royal Dornoch Golf Course has for many years been listed as oneof the very best courses in the world. Nairn West, the favourite haunt of Prime Ministers and celebrities. There are many others, some of which feature on our web site, but many we want to introduce you to personally.
