                <p>This is a superb base from which to explore some of the famous North of Scotland courses, Royal Dornoch, Nairn West and the new “super-courses” at Spey Valley and Castle Stuart. We are less than 30 minutes from most of these, Dornoch being the furthest away at 45 minutes. As well, we are close to a range of other excellent courses.
                <br/><br/>Exclusive means, we only worry about you. Your party of three or four golfers, (and partners if you wish), will have all this to themselves.</p>
